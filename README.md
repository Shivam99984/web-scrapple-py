   - Next run time
   - User association

3. **ScrapingResult**
   - Job association
   - Scraped data
   - Timestamp

## 📚 Usage Guide

### 1. User Authentication
- Register a new account
- Login with your credentials
- Manage your profile

### 2. Web Scraping

2. Specify CSS selectors
3. Preview the results
4. Save or schedule the scraping job

### 3. Scheduled Jobs
- Create recurring scraping tasks
- Set intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
- View and manage scheduled jobs
- Monitor scraping results

### 4. Data Export
- Export to CSV
- Export to JSON
- Export to Excel (XLSX)
- Download files directly
